# Telecom-Churn
It's a group coursework for the Master of Data Science.  
We first performed machine learning on telecom churn data to predict customer churn.
The methods used are decision trees and random forests.
After training the model an innovative approach for finding an optimal probability threshold is presented.
All the coding is in the R Markdown file to create the Poster.pdf file.
